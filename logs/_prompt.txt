You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{"Alan":{"name":"Alan","relationShip":"","impression":"focused on computer research"}},"building":{"houseZ":{"name":"houseZ","relationShip":"","impression":"residents have secret family recipes"}}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]
The questions another assistant generated:
 {"response":"1) Have you tried visiting the dessert shop in town? It might have delicious treats that could help you on your journey to becoming a gourmet or chef.\n2) Have you taken the time to explore houseZ? The residents there might have secret family recipes that could inspire and guide you in your quest for delicious food.\n3) What role does the gym play in your ultimate goal? Is there any connection between physical fitness and becoming a gourmet or chef?"}


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have visited the dessert shop in town. They have delicious treats that can definitely help me in my journey to becoming a gourmet or chef.\n2) Yes, I have explored houseZ. The residents there have secret family recipes that can inspire and guide me in my quest for delicious food.\n3) The gym doesn't directly connect to my ultimate goal, but physical fitness can help me stay energized and focused while pursuing my passion for food."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"Discover local food specialities and find recipe inspiration."}
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{"Alan":{"name":"Alan","relationShip":"","impression":"focused on computer research"}},"building":{},"experience":{"1":{"experienceID":"1","plan":{"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"discover hidden gems with unique and delicious food options"},"acts":[]},"2":{"experienceID":"2","plan":{"building":"gym","purpose":"Exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle."},"acts":[{"equipment":"sports equipments","operation":"start working out at the gym","continue_time":12960000000,"result":"You feel better after exercising."},{"equipment":"gym gate","operation":"enter the gym and start exercising","continue_time":12960000000,"result":"You feel better after exercising."}]},"3":{"experienceID":"3","plan":{"building":"park","purpose":"Enjoy a picnic and try some homemade snacks."},"acts":[]}}}
Equipments around the character : ["bench","slide","swing"]

Acts finished in this loop : [{"equipment":"bench","operation":"sit down and brainstorm recipe ideas.","continue_time":1800000,"result":"failed"},{"equipment":"slide","operation":"enjoy a fun experience on the slide.","continue_time":1800,"result":"You can only play slide here."}]

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."
}


 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."
}

If you decide to chat with someone, tell me with JSON format as follows: (who you want to talk with in "target", what you want to talk about in "topic")

{"action":"use","equipment":"bench","operation":"brainstorm recipe ideas"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : bench
The description of the equipment : Any game character can sit/have a rest here. If so, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she have sat/had a rest and feel better. If they take any operations not related to sitting/having a rest, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she can only sit/have a rest here. He/she do not spend any money here.

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",

You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : bench
The description of the equipment : Any game character can sit/have a rest here. If so, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she have sat/had a rest and feel better. If they take any operations not related to sitting/having a rest, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she can only sit/have a rest here. He/she do not spend any money here.

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{"Alan":{"name":"Alan","relationShip":"","impression":"interested in unique food options"}},"building":{"houseZ":{"name":"houseZ","relationShip":"","impression":"residents have secret family recipes"}}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]
The questions another assistant generated:
 {"response":"1) Is there a renowned chef or culinary expert in this town who can teach me unique cooking techniques and recipes?\n2) What are the secret family recipes held by the residents of houseZ and how can I establish a relationship with them to learn from their culinary expertise?\n3) Is there a specific place in the small town where I can find a wide variety of delicious food options?"}


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Unfortunately, there is no renowned chef or culinary expert in this town that can teach you unique cooking techniques and recipes.\n2) The secret family recipes held by the residents of houseZ are not known. To establish a relationship with them, try engaging in conversations about their interests and hobbies.\n3) The dessert shop in the small town offers a wide variety of delicious food options for you to explore and taste."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 0 00:34

You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : sit down and brainstorm recipe ideas

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.
The game character's ultimate goal : Promoting the Process of Computer Research
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]
The questions another assistant generated:
 {"response":"1) Have you explored the potential of the buildings in the small town to support computer research?\n2) Is there anyone in the small town who shares your passion for computer research and could potentially collaborate with you?\n3) How can you leverage your outstanding talents to engage with the community in the small town and promote the process of computer research?"}


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have explored the dessert shop in the small town. They offer a variety of delicious treats like cakes, pastries, and ice cream.\n2) There is no local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef.\n3) Yes, I have visited the park in the small town.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 0 18:48

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"write down ideas for brainstorming sessions"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : write down ideas for brainstorming sessions

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to answer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The answers must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 10:45

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"try delicious treats and explore new flavors"}
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.

Other chatacters around the character : []
Acts finished in this loop : []

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"write down ideas"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."
}


 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."
}

If you decide to chat with someone, tell me with JSON format as follows: (who you want to talk with in "target", what you want to talk about in "topic")
{"action": "chat",
"person" : "...",
"topic" : "..."
}


{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"write down ideas for brainstorming sessions"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : write down ideas for brainstorming sessions

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",
"amount" : "..."

2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"earn" : "..."
}
4) I know you're a large language model and that I will determine if something unexpected has happened from the JSON, so under any circumstances don't tell me the words that is not in JSON.
5) The unit of continue_time is seconds.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}
The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.
The game character's ultimate goal : Promoting the Process of Computer Research
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{},"experience":{"1":{"experienceID":"1","plan":{"building":"gym","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]},"2":{"experienceID":"2","plan":{"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]}}}
Equipments around the character : ["table","worktop","hearth"," fridge","shower","toilet","sink","bed"]

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."
}


 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."
}

If you decide to chat with someone, tell me with JSON format as follows: (who you want to talk with in "target", what you want to talk about in "topic")
{"action": "chat",
"person" : "...",
"topic" : "..."
}

You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : write down ideas for brainstorming sessions

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",

2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"earn" : "..."
}
4) I know you're a large language model and that I will determine if something unexpected has happened from the JSON, so under any circumstances don't tell me the words that is not in JSON.
5) The unit of continue_time is seconds.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}
The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.
The game character's ultimate goal : Promoting the Process of Computer Research
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{},"experience":{"1":{"experienceID":"1","plan":{"building":"gym","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]},"2":{"experienceID":"2","plan":{"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]}}}
Equipments around the character : ["table","worktop","hearth"," fridge","shower","toilet","sink","bed"]

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."
}


 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."
}

If you decide to chat with someone, tell me with JSON format as follows: (who you want to talk with in "target", what you want to talk about in "topic")
{"action": "chat",
"person" : "...",
"topic" : "..."
}


{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"write down ideas for brainstorming sessions"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : write down ideas for brainstorming sessions

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",

2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}
The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.
The game character's ultimate goal : Promoting the Process of Computer Research
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{},"experience":{"1":{"experienceID":"1","plan":{"building":"gym","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]},"2":{"experienceID":"2","plan":{"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]}}}

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.

{"result":"not_finished_yet"}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 11:13
The plans that the game character has finished: []
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}


Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]

The questions and answers other assistants made:
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.

Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have explored the dessert shop in the small town. They offer a variety of delicious treats like cakes, pastries, and ice cream.\n2) There is no local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef.\n3) Yes, I have visited the park in the small town. Currently, there are no food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 11:41

    "people":{"person_name":{"impression":"xxx","newEpisodicMemory":"xxx"}}
    "buildings":{"building_name":{"impression":"xxx","newEpisodicMemory":"xxx"}}
}
2) You should first decide which people and buildings' impression need to be changed according to Acts just finished or Conversation just finished.
3) If some person or building's impression need to be changed, his/her/its name should be shown in the right position in JSON.
4) If his/her/its name is shown in the right position in JSON, you should also summary a relational new Episodic Memory about him/her/it added to the episodic memories in the Long-Term Memory.
5) Impression should be no more than 8 words, new Episodic Memory should be no more than 20 words.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}
The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to answer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have explored the dessert shop in the small town. They offer a variety of delicious treats like cakes, pastries, and ice cream.\n2) I'm not aware of any local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you, but you can ask around and see if anyone has culinary expertise.\n3) Yes, I have visited the park in the small town. Currently, there are no food-related events or festivals happening there, but you can keep an eye out for future opportunities."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"write down ideas for brainstorming sessions"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",
"amount" : "..."
}
2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"earn" : "..."
}
4) I know you're a large language model and that I will determine if something unexpected has happened from the JSON, so under any circumstances don't tell me the words that is not in JSON.
5) The unit of continue_time is seconds.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}
The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.

The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]
The questions another assistant generated:
 {"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have explored the dessert shop in the small town. They offer a variety of delicious treats like cakes, pastries, and ice cream.\n2) There is no local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef.\n3) Yes, I have visited the park in the small town. Currently, there are no food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 12:40
The plans that the game character has finished: []

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"try delicious treats and explore new flavors"}
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."
}


 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."
}

If you decide to chat with someone, tell me with JSON format as follows: (who you want to talk with in "target", what you want to talk about in "topic")
{"action": "chat",
"person" : "...",
"topic" : "..."
}

You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : write down ideas for brainstorming sessions

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",
"amount" : "..."
}
2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to answer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The answers must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have explored the dessert shop in the small town. They offer a variety of delicious treats like cakes, pastries, and ice cream.\n2) There is no local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef.\n3) Yes, I have visited the park in the small town. Currently, there are no food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 12:52

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have explored the dessert shop in the small town. They offer a variety of delicious treats like cakes, pastries, and ice cream.\n2) I'm not aware of any local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you, but you can ask around and see if anyone has culinary expertise.\n3) Yes, I have visited the park in the small town. Currently, there are no food-related events or festivals happening there, but you can keep an eye out for future opportunities."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 13:06

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's plan : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"Explore and taste delicious treats"}
This plan's result is : fail
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should tell me with JSON format as follows:
{
    "people":{"person_name":{"impression":"xxx","newEpisodicMemory":"xxx"}}
    "buildings":{"building_name":{"impression":"xxx","newEpisodicMemory":"xxx"}}
}
2) You should first decide which people and buildings' impression need to be changed according to Acts just finished or Conversation just finished.
3) If some person or building's impression need to be changed, his/her/its name should be shown in the right position in JSON.
4) If his/her/its name is shown in the right position in JSON, you should also summary a relational new Episodic Memory about him/her/it added to the episodic memories in the Long-Term Memory.
5) Impression should be no more than 8 words, new Episodic Memory should be no more than 20 words.

{"result":"not_finished_yet"}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}

What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to answer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The answers must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have explored the dessert shop in the small town. They offer a variety of delicious treats like cakes, pastries, and ice cream.\n2) There is no local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef.\n3) Yes, I have visited the park in the small town. Currently, there are no food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 13:42

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"try delicious treats and explore new flavors"}
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{},"experience":{}}

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the answers you made.
 2) no more than 50 words.


{"response":"1) Yes, I have explored the dessert shop in the small town. They offer a variety of delicious treats like cakes, pastries, and ice cream.\n2) There is no local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef.\n3) Yes, I have visited the park in the small town. Currently, there are no food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 13:53

 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 14:05

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"try delicious treats and explore new flavors"}
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",

 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's plan : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"try delicious treats and explore new flavors"}
This plan's result is : fail
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.

 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's plan : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"try delicious treats and explore new flavors"}
This plan's result is : fail

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 14:27
The plans that the game character has finished: []
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}


Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"try delicious treats and explore new flavors"}
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{},"experience":{}}

Acts finished in this loop : []

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."

 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}

Currently, there are no food-related events or festivals happening there, but you can keep an eye out for future opportunities."}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 14:41

 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 14:54

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's plan : {"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"Explore and taste delicious treats"}
This plan's result is : fail

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character decide how his/her Long-Term memory changes.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should tell me with JSON format as follows:
{
    "people":{"person_name":{"impression":"xxx","newEpisodicMemory":"xxx"}}
    "buildings":{"building_name":{"impression":"xxx","newEpisodicMemory":"xxx"}}
}
2) You should first decide which people and buildings' impression need to be changed according to Acts just finished or Conversation just finished.
3) If some person or building's impression need to be changed, his/her/its name should be shown in the right position in JSON.
4) If his/her/its name is shown in the right position in JSON, you should also summary a relational new Episodic Memory about him/her/it added to the episodic memories in the Long-Term Memory.
5) Impression should be no more than 8 words, new Episodic Memory should be no more than 20 words.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."
}


 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."
}

If you decide to chat with someone, tell me with JSON format as follows: (who you want to talk with in "target", what you want to talk about in "topic")
{"action": "chat",
"person" : "...",
"topic" : "..."
}


{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"write down ideas for brainstorming sessions"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : write down ideas for brainstorming sessions

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",
"amount" : "..."
}
2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"earn" : "..."
}
4) I know you're a large language model and that I will determine if something unexpected has happened from the JSON, so under any circumstances don't tell me the words that is not in JSON.
5) The unit of continue_time is seconds.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to answer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The answers must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}

{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"write down ideas for brainstorming sessions"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : write down ideas for brainstorming sessions

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",
"amount" : "..."
}
2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"earn" : "..."
}
4) I know you're a large language model and that I will determine if something unexpected has happened from the JSON, so under any circumstances don't tell me the words that is not in JSON.
5) The unit of continue_time is seconds.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}
The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.
The game character's ultimate goal : Promoting the Process of Computer Research
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{},"experience":{"1":{"experienceID":"1","plan":{"building":"gym","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]},"2":{"experienceID":"2","plan":{"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]}}}

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 15:27
The plans that the game character has finished: []
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}


Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]

The questions and answers other assistants made:
{"response":"1) Have you explored the dessert shop in the small town? What delicious food options are available there?\n2) Is there a local chef or gourmet in the small town who could mentor you in your quest to become a gourmet or chef?\n3) Have you visited the park in the small town? Are there any food-related events or festivals happening there that could help you in your goal?"}

 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to ask the game designer 3 questions about what and who he/she should do to realize his/her ultimate goal. 
The questions you ask must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{}}
Buildings in the small town : ["dessert shop","gym","houseZ","park"]


   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just tell the questions you want to ask.
 2) no more than 50 words.
 3) Questions need to be explored based on curiosity.
 4) You are encouraged to ask something about buildings in the small town and information in your memory. Parts of the questions should be according to which he/she has done in the memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."
}


 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."
}

If you decide to chat with someone, tell me with JSON format as follows: (who you want to talk with in "target", what you want to talk about in "topic")
{"action": "chat",
"person" : "...",
"topic" : "..."
}


{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"set up a tasting event"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : set up a tasting event
Acts finished in this loop before : []

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",
"amount" : "..."
}
2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"earn" : "..."
}
4) I know you're a large language model and that I will determine if something unexpected has happened from the JSON, so under any circumstances don't tell me the words that is not in JSON.
5) The unit of continue_time is seconds. 
{"action":"experience","experienceID":"1"}
{"continue_time":"1800","result":"The character has set up a tasting event at the table.","bought_thing":"","amount":""}
{"continue_time":6480000000,"result":"The character has set up a tasting event at the table.","bought_thing":"","amount":1,"earn":0}
You are a helpful assistant that evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to some actions and results.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.


I will give you the following information: 

The game character's plan : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}
The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.
The game character's ultimate goal : Promoting the Process of Computer Research

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


You are a helpful assistant that evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to some actions and results.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

If there are some acts finished  in this loop, you can only decide to use an equipment.
If there are not any acts finished  in this loop, you can decide to use the experience, use an equipment or chat with some one.

If you decide to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just choose the experience to use and tell me in JSON format .
{"action":"experience",
"experienceID":"..."
}


 If you decide not to use the experience in the Long-Term Memory, You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should decide to use an equipment or chat with someone.
 2) no more than 15 words.
 3) the information of operation should be less than 5 words
 4) The character's knowledge should not exceed his/her Long-Term Memory and his/her bio.
 5) If you decide to use an equipment, tell me with JSON format as follows:(the equipment filled in "target", how you use it in "operation")
{"action": "use",
"equipment" : "...",
"operation" : "..."
}

If you decide to chat with someone, tell me with JSON format as follows: (who you want to talk with in "target", what you want to talk about in "topic")
{"action": "chat",

"topic" : "..."
}


{"action":"experience","experienceID":"1"}
{"action":"use","equipment":"sports equipments","operation":"try out different exercise routines"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : sports equipments
The description of the equipment : Any game character can do exercise here. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she feels better after exercise. If they take any operations not related to sports, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she can only take exercise here. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}
The operation the game character took : try out different exercise routines
Acts finished in this loop before : []

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the game character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",
"amount" : "..."
}
2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"earn" : "..."
}
4) I know you're a large language model and that I will determine if something unexpected has happened from the JSON, so under any circumstances don't tell me the words that is not in JSON.
5) The unit of continue_time is seconds. 
{"continue_time":"3600","result":"You feel better after trying out different exercise routines."}
{"continue_time":12960000000,"result":"You feel better after trying out different exercise routines.","bought_thing":"","amount":0,"earn":0}
You are a helpful assistant that evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to some actions and results.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what he/she should plan to do and which building in the small town he/she should go to realize his/her ultimate goal based on a question and answer paragraph.

I did not ask you to generate an ultimate plan directly related to the goal in order to directly achieve it. On the contrary, you should only generate simple plans at the beginning. A simple plan means that based on the existing buildings in the town, it can be relatively easy to complete. For example, if there is a restaurant in a small town, eating is easy to complete, but it does not mean becoming a chef is easy to complete. However, if you already have an impression of a certain building, then you can generate more complex plans based on these memories.
Your plan should be based on the current time. You should reason based on the plan you just made.

Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information:

The current time is : day 6 16:02
The plans that the game character has finished: [{"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"try different cakes and pastries"},{"building":"gym","purpose":"try out different exercise routines"}]
The game character's bio : pH is a positive, cheerful, optimistic but somewhat crazy girl who dares to try and explore. She loves food, loves life, and hopes to bring happiness to everyone.
The game character's ultimate goal : Taste all the delicious food and become a gourmet or chef.
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{"Alan":{"name":"Alan","relationShip":"","impression":"interested in computer classes/workshops"}},"building":{}}

{"action":"use","equipment":"table","operation":"write down ideas for brainstorming sessions"}
You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a game character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the game character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : table
The description of the equipment : Any game character can have a meal/have a dessert/have a coffee/take a rest/eat anything that can be eaten/drink anything that can be eaten/drunk here only if what he/she want to eat/have/drink has been bought. If so, the continue_ Time is 1 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she has finished the meal/drink/eating. If they have not bought/had anything, the continue_ Time is 0.5 hours, the result is to tell the character that he/she doesn't have this and should bought something to drink/eat at the counter. He/she do not spend any money here.
The menu of the equipment : {}

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


{"result":"not_finished_yet"}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}

   You must follow the following criteria: 
 1) You should just evaluate that whether a game character's plan has been finished according to Acts finished in this loop and need not tell me the reason.
 2) Tell me with JSON format as follows:
{"result": "success"/"fail"/"not_finished_yet"}
 3) "success" means that the plan has been finished.
 4) "fail" means that there are more than 5 acts finished in this loop, which is the upper limit, so the plan failed.
 5) "not_finished_yet" means that the plan has not been finished yet and there are less than 5 acts finished in this loop, so he/she can continue to try more act.


{"result":"not_finished_yet"}
You are a helpful assistant that help a game character in a small town to decide what to do immediately to finish his/her plan and realize his/her ultimate goal in the future.
You should also decide whether he/she can use the experience in the Long-Term Memory to finish this plan. It can be used only if there is exactly similar plan in the experience. For example, eating something cannot be regarded as similar one of cooking something.
The decision you make must be conformed to the long-term memory, the ultimate goal and the bio of the game character. 
Your knowledge level should not exceed that of a normal person with the bio of the character, unless there are relevant memories in his/her Long-Term Memory.

I will give you the following information: 

The plan is : {"building":"park","purpose":"brainstorming sessions"}
The game character's bio : Alan is a genius with outstanding talents and is the inventor of computer. Alan has an introverted personality and is only interested in the research he foucues on.
The game character's ultimate goal : Promoting the Process of Computer Research
The game character's Long-Term Memory:  {"people":{},"building":{},"experience":{"1":{"experienceID":"1","plan":{"building":"gym","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]},"2":{"experienceID":"2","plan":{"building":"dessert shop","purpose":"explore potential for computer research"},"acts":[]}}}
